      <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
      <p>
        Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that securely records transactions across multiple computers. It provides a transparent and immutable record of data, making it highly resistant to tampering and fraud. Blockchain technology forms the foundation for various applications, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

      <h2>How Does Blockchain Work?</h2>
      <p>
        At its core, a blockchain consists of blocks of data that are linked together in a chronological order. Each block contains a unique identifier (hash) and a reference to the previous block. This creates a chain of blocks, hence the name "blockchain."
      </p>
      <p>
        When a new transaction occurs, it is grouped with other transactions into a block. Miners (participants in the blockchain network) then compete to solve a mathematical puzzle, and the first miner to find the solution broadcasts it to the network. The other miners validate the solution and, if consensus is reached, the block is added to the chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a block is added to the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to alter or delete the data it contains. This immutability and transparency make blockchain technology a trusted solution for various applications, such as supply chain management, voting systems, and financial transactions.

      <h2>Key Concepts in Blockchain</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Decentralization:</strong> Unlike traditional centralized systems, blockchain operates on a decentralized network of computers (nodes) that collectively maintain the ledger. This eliminates the need for a central authority and increases security and transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Consensus Mechanism:</strong> To maintain the integrity of the blockchain, a consensus mechanism is used. It ensures that all participants agree on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the chain. Popular consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cryptographic Hashing:</strong> Each block in the blockchain has a unique cryptographic hash that is generated using a hashing algorithm. This hash acts as a digital fingerprint for the block and helps maintain the integrity of the data.
